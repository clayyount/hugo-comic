[{"content":"You may not be aware of this, but I\u0026rsquo;ve been drawing webcomics off and on again since 2000. I\u0026rsquo;ve taken some long breaks and my update schedule has been spotty at best, but I\u0026rsquo;ve always considered it a part of my identity. I draw comics, even if I\u0026rsquo;n not drawing them right now.\nThere is a small subset of my readership that knows that before there was Hamlet\u0026rsquo;s Danish, and before there was Rob and Elliot, I did a webcomic called Ghostcat. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t very good, but after it ended in 2003, I adopted the title as my internet handle. I was \u0026ldquo;ghostcat\u0026rdquo; online, and I associated it with my comic artist identity.\nToday, I\u0026rsquo;m ressurecting the title \u0026ldquo;Ghostcat Comics\u0026rdquo; for a new series that I\u0026rsquo;m really excited about. They are shorter and more direct than Hamlet\u0026rsquo;s Danish comics, and they are formatted for social media. I\u0026rsquo;ll be posting them on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and wherever else I can think of, so be sure to follow me, and I\u0026rsquo;ll bring the comics to you!\n","tags":null,"title":"Ghostcat Comics (Re)Launch","uri":"http://localhost:1313/blog/2019/05/27/ghostcat-comics-relaunch/"},{"content":"A Little History I originally developed my Squarespace webcomic template because I wasn\u0026rsquo;t happy with having to use Wordpress+ComicPress and I wanted another option. I latched on to Squarespace because it had a pretty robust developer platform and allowed for more customization than any other online website builder. Also, when I started, Squarespace was $8 a month, and cheaper than most hosting solutions, so it seemed like a great deal. Since then, Squarespace has let their developer platform languish, and their plan that supports developer templates jumped up to $26 a month. The final straw was after I\u0026rsquo;d spent hours and hours working with their platform, I discovered a bug that fundamentally broke my comic archive template. I contacted Squarespace multiple times, and they\u0026rsquo;ve refused to address it. In short, I wanted out.\nFast forward a couple years, and I still hadn\u0026rsquo;t found a better solution that ticked all the boxes. I looked into Ghost CMS, but it lacked a lot of features, and it runs on Node JS, which makes hosting pricey. Grawlix looked promising too, but I\u0026rsquo;ve had security issues in the past with LAMP stacks, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to implement a not very well documented solution that may not get timely security fixes. Turns out, the creators stopped supporting it.\nEnter Static Site Generators So after I\u0026rsquo;d done a good amount of research into alternatives, my friend tells me good things about something called static site generators. The idea of foregoing server side code entirely and generating your entire site as flat HTML files everytime you publish sounded crazy, but the upsides are incredibly compelling:\nYour site is wicked fast. No server side code and no databases means you are just serving up static files. You can host your site anywhere and do it for pennies or even free. It\u0026rsquo;s incredibly secure because there\u0026rsquo;s no server side code to exploit or database to hack. If you use Github in your publish process, your site is automatically backed up and versioned. The first static site generator I tried was Jekyll. It was the oldest one with the most support, but sites with a lot of entries take a long time to build, so that was a no-go for webcomics, which can have thousands of entries. Then I tried Hugo, which uses Go templates, so it is fast enough to handle comics with thousands of entries without a problem. I started working on a comic template for my site, but there were a few things holding me back:\nStatic site generators need to use the command line interface (CLI), which requires linux, windows, or mac. No iPad. There\u0026rsquo;s no Content Management System (CMS), and no updating via the web. No server side code meant no user-generated input. So no comments, no contact forms, and no store. Now, I\u0026rsquo;m ok with using the CLI and editing markdown files without a CMS, but I was looking for a solution I could recommend to anybody, and it felt like a solution for developers by developers. Also, I\u0026rsquo;d moved over to drawing on an iPad, and I wanted to not have to lug my laptop around if I wanted to update my site.\nEnter Netlify Netlify offers a couple of things that were game changers for me, and made me take the plunge into rebuilding my website on a their platform.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s free hosting tier is good enough to run my entire website. It has a built in web-based CMS for Hugo so I can publish from my iPad It hooks into Github for publishing, so I get a free backup/version control It even offers basic contact forms for free So, I\u0026rsquo;ve rebuilt my website using Hugo, Github, and Netlify, and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t be happier with the results. I\u0026rsquo;ve copied over all the features and content from my old site except comments. I decided to leave those out because I don\u0026rsquo;t think it added much, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to have to manage the spam. If I really want to add them back in, I can use something like Discus or Intense Debate. Hugo+Github+Netlify isn\u0026rsquo;t as accesible for people with no coding experience as Squarespace is, but it\u0026rsquo;s perfect for me, and if you are willing to put in the effort, it could be perfect for you too. I\u0026rsquo;ll be working on a generic comic website template and instructions in the future, but for now, if any adventurous artists want to take a look at my website\u0026rsquo;s code and go it alone, it\u0026rsquo;s all up on Github for anyone to clone.\nMoving Forward I know my Squarespace templates have gotten a good amount of interest from comic creators who wanted to use Squarespace, but I don\u0026rsquo;t really have the time or energy to maintain it by following everything they change or break. Also, they burned me pretty bad with the unfixable bug, so I\u0026rsquo;ve pretty much lost interest in developing on their platform. I know Hugo and Github can seem daunting to the uninitiated, and hopefully services like Netlify will continue to make it even easier for artists to set up their sites without having to deal with too much code or command line.\n","tags":["website","Hugo","Netlify","GitHub","Squarespace"],"title":"Goodbye Squarespace, Hello Hugo","uri":"http://localhost:1313/blog/2018/11/18/goodbye-squarespace-hello-hugo/"},{"content":"I did an illustration of The Goon for an online art competition\nI\u0026rsquo;m still teaching myself how to use Procreate effectively, so this one had a pretty good amount of trial and error as I was figuring things out. I also used a modified old dutch painting technique Ray Frenden blogged about, and I like it a LOT. I also have a process video if anyone is interested. ","tags":null,"title":"The Goon Illustration","uri":"http://localhost:1313/blog/2016/02/26/the-goon-illustration/"},{"content":"\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been using the iPad Pro for a couple months now, and I’m going to give my impressions strictly from an illustrator/comic artist perspective. If you want a review of the device as a laptop replacement or next-gen tablet, others have done a better job than I could, so please check them out.\nHow does the drawing experience stack up against the competition? The question most artists want answered is how well does the drawing experience stack up vs a Cintiq or a Surface Pro (3/4). The short answer is extremely well. I have a Cintiq 21UX and a Surface Pro 3, and have tested the updated versions of those products in stores, and the Apple Pencil blows them away. I will get into specifics of why in a sec, but the gist of it is the Apple Pencil just feels more like a real pencil. Drawing with it feels like drawing on a real sketchpad, and the first time I tried it I was literally taken aback. The small lag I’d come to expect from using a digital stylus was gone. The accuracy was amazing. The pressure curve felt natural. I knew within 30 seconds that I was going to buy one.\nFor me, the overall drawing feel of a stylus can be broken out into three metrics: polling rate, parallax and pressure sensitivity.\nPolling rate The biggest determining factor in how responsive a stylus feels is the polling rate, or how many times in a second stylus position data can be registered. Wacom’s Cintiqs have a polling rate of 133 htz, while the Apple Pencil has a polling rate of 250 htz. The difference between these two numbers is a large part of what makes using the Apple Pencil feel so natural. The line you are drawing has significantly less lag behind your pen tip and it feels like you are interacting directly with the pixels rather than drawing a path for your brush to follow. I haven’t seen any specs listing the polling rate of the SP3 or SP4, but I can tell you anecdotally that the SP3 lags worse than a Cintiq, and the SP4 doesn’t feel much better.\nParallax Parallax is the disconnect between where your stylus touches the screen and actual screen pixels. There is about a ½ centimeter separation between the pen tip and the screen on Cintiqs and the SP3, which gives you a disconnect. The iPad Pro and the SP4 both use a technology where the glass is affixed directly to the screen with no gap, so the parallax is greatly reduced. This gives you more precision when you are drawing, and makes it feel like you are drawing directly on the surface.\nPressure sensitivity Apple has not released the specs for the number for pressure levels the Apple Pencil supports, but it feels comparable to a Cintiq, so my guess would be at least 1024. The SP3 has 256, which actually isn’t terrible, but it’s noticeable when you are trying to make subtle line width transitions. Apple doesn’t allow you to adjust the pressure curve on a system level, which usually would be a knock against it, but they did such a good job setting a default natural pressure curve that I don’t have a problem with it. Also, some apps like Procreate 3 will let you adjust the pressure curve inside the app.\nHonorable mention: Tilt Another feature that the Apple Pencil has that affects the experience is tilt sensitivity. This lets you do some very natural looking pencil shading. Wacom supports this too, but I wanted to give it a special shout-out because it’s awesome and gives you results you can’t get on a Surface Pro.\nAs great as the drawing experience is, there are a couple things Apple could improve. For instance, the pencil tip glides a little too smoothly over the glass of the iPad Pro’s screen for my taste. The new SP4 pens have a tip with a little more tooth to it so it feels more like drawing on a paper texture. Also, there’s no eraser or place to store the pencil, and the casing is too smooth and prone to rolling off surfaces.\nCan it do everything a professional artist needs? The short answer is “it depends on what you need”. The iPad Pro is Apple’s first iOS device with the “Pro” moniker, so pro level apps are still in their infancy. There isn’t anything that has feature parity with powerhouses like Photoshop or Illustrator, but there are apps that can create a pro-level illustration or comic from start to finish with no problem. The biggest hurdle is figuring out how to use these new programs to accomplish the same things you did on a desktop OS. I’ll focus on the main apps that I use in my workflow to give you a sense of what is possible. These all support copy/paste to clipboard, so working among the apps is pretty painless.\nProcreate 3 Out of all the drawing apps I’ve tried on iOS, Procreate 3 is by far the best. On the surface, it feels like a pretty basic drawing app, with only a few sliders, tools, and brushes visible in the UI. But in actuality, it pretty close to Manga Studio in its feature set, and it\u0026rsquo;s absolutely criminally priced at only $5.99. I\u0026rsquo;d easily pay ten times that.\nProcreate has done an excellent job of building an app from the ground up with a touch interface in mind. They have a minimalist interface, but incorporate touch gestures that work like keyboard shortcuts to really speed up your process. For example, two fingers tapping the screen is undo and three fingers tapping is redo. This works as quickly and efficiently as mapping an undo button to the stylus on a Wacom pen. On a Cintiq or SP3, I have to work on a table top to keep one hand on the keyboard for shortcuts, which makes truly portable drawing pretty much impossible. With the touch gestures/controls, I can hold the iPad Pro like I would a sketchbook and still have quick access to all the commands I need. It takes a little getting used to, but it’s super useful. I highly recommend checking out their free iBook Artist Handbook to see what all the features are. You’ll be surprised.\nBonus: It also will automatically make an awesome replay video of your drawing process that you can easily edit in iMovie and upload to Youtube. Here\u0026rsquo;s one of mine: Graphic This used to be called iDraw, and it’s a vector illustration app from Autodesk. It isn’t quite as well thought out for the iPad as Procreate. It’s a ported desktop app, and it shows, but it is also very powerful and replicates most of the core functionality of Illustrator. You can use it in conjunction with an app called AnyFont to import and use your own custom fonts (which you can then cut and paste into Procreate), which is essential for comic artists.\nPixelmator This is as close as you’ll get to Photoshop on iOS. Another desktop port, but it’s great for resizing/cropping/exporting images for web, applying filters, and tweaking colors.\nHonorable Mention: Astropad Astropad lets you connect your iPad Pro to your Mac or PC and use it as a second screen. It also supports the pressure sensitivity with the Apple Pencil, so it effectively turns your iPad Pro into a Cintiq. There are a couple of caveats, though. The connection to your computer reintroduces some lag, (about the same as a Cintiq) so you lose the 250 htz responsiveness the Pencil natively has. Also, the screen momentarily pixelates as you draw which can be a bit distracting. I much prefer drawing on the iPad itself, so I wouldn’t recommend using it unless you have to use a desktop app.\nSummary The iPad Pro isn’t for everyone… yet. I think Procreate gives you enough functionality that if you are an illustrator or comic artist, it could be your sole machine so long as you are open to adapting your work flow. It’s the most convenient portable digital studio solution, and drawing on it is pure joy. I haven’t really touched my SP3 or Cintiq since I got it, and I\u0026rsquo;ll be looking to sell my SP3 soon. If you do graphic design, video editing, animation, web development etc, it’s not quite there yet, so if you are looking for one machine to do it all, you are probably better off with a SP4. But the iPad Pro has only been out for a couple months and app developers have only begun to take advantage it. I can’t wait to see how things look in a year or two.\n4.5 out of 5 ","tags":["iPad Pro","Apple Pencil","Procreate","Review"],"title":"iPad Pro Review","uri":"http://localhost:1313/blog/2016/02/08/ipad-pro-review/"},{"content":" I can finally promote the fact the my brother Hampton is going to be the new voice of Crow T. Robot in the upcoming MST3K reboot! To say that this is a big deal for him is a massive understatement.\nWhen we were growing up, we were both huge fans of the show (Though Hampton always loved it more). We pooled our resources to buy a bunch of tapes, and got to the point where we were quoting them a lot. We would even force our friends to sit through multi-hour endurance marathons. In short, we wore those tapes OUT. At one point I remember having a conversation with him about how, although it could never happen, working on that show would be The Coolest Job Ever™. To see Hampton achieve a childhood dream means so much to me and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t be more proud! All fraternal bias aside, I honestly can\u0026rsquo;t think of a better person for the job.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the thing though, they need to meet their stretch goal of 5.5 million to get a full 12 episode season. Also, if they meet that goal, there\u0026rsquo;s a much better chance that a network or streaming service will pick them up as a continuing series.

It\u0026rsquo;s been pretty dead around here. I could attribute it to a lot of things and make excuses, but in the end, I\u0026rsquo;ve been allowing other things in life to take over my productivity. I tend to do this thing where I miss a deadline, then avoid the task completely because I feel bad about it. Couple that with the fact that I\u0026rsquo;m passionate about, but lose interest in things quickly, and it pretty much explains my entire update history. If I\u0026rsquo;m faced with sitting down for five hours to make a Hamlet\u0026rsquo;s Danish comic, and I\u0026rsquo;m not feeling it, chances are that I\u0026rsquo;m watching TV instead. And if I do want to do something else that\u0026rsquo;s creative, I feel like I have to draw the comic before I can get to it.\nBut then, I thought, \u0026ldquo;Wait. This is my HOBBY. Why am I stressing out?\u0026rdquo;\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m trying something new. Instead of holding myself to a weekly comic deadline that I know I\u0026rsquo;m not going to stick to, I\u0026rsquo;m going to harness my short attention span and make a goal of just trying to do something creative every week. It might be a Hamlet\u0026rsquo;s Danish, it might be an art piece, it might be a series of sketches, it might be working on a short standalone like my Birds comic, or a longer comic issue. This way I can work on what I\u0026rsquo;m feeling passionate about, and hopefully that will make me more creative in general, and keep me from making comics I only think are kind of funny. I\u0026rsquo;m experimenting here, so let\u0026rsquo;s hope it works.\nThanks to the power of the modern internet, you can still keep up with Hamlet\u0026rsquo;s Danish as it updates via RSS, and if you follow me on Twitter, Facebook or Tumblr, you\u0026rsquo;ll get a feed of the comics plus whatever other things I work on.

If your comic archives are more than 1000, or you will reach it soon, please find another solution. I\u0026rsquo;m sorry to have launched with this limitation, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t have an archive with 1000 entries to test on and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t documented, so I wasn\u0026rsquo;t aware of it. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping Squarespace will implement a fix to a separate bug with their itemCount API so I can use a workaround, but it\u0026rsquo;s been more than 6 months since I alerted them and they have yet to inform me when a fix is coming. As it stands, there is no way around this limitation.\nAt the beginning of the year, I released a Squarespace template for webcomic artists. The response has been pretty good, and hopefully some of you have put it to good use. I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten some feedback, and the two biggest complaints are that the (recently increased) $18 per month developer account is too expensive, and the template is too hard to customize for someone without a lot of coding skills.\nSince I released the template, Squarespace has made some important updates to their platform that have allowed me to create a new easier solution that doesn\u0026rsquo;t require a custom template and just uses some copy and paste code. This means it\u0026rsquo;ll work with ANY Squarespace plan including the $8/month basic plan. I\u0026rsquo;ve put together some video tutorials to help you get the basics of a site up and running in about 30 minutes. I\u0026rsquo;ll be adding some more videos as I complete them, and am willing to take suggestions for tutorial topics. If you are a web developer and want 100% control, you can still use my original template as a launching off point, but this new solution is incredibly versatile and I think it is the best option for 99% of people.\nJust an FYI, I am nowhere near as practiced as my brother as speaking into a microphone, so please excuse my nervousness.

This means it\u0026rsquo;ll work with ANY Squarespace plan including the $8/month basic plan. I\u0026rsquo;ve also put together a video tutorial on how to get a site up and running in less than 10 minutes, as well some tutorials that cover some of the customizations you can do with your site. If you want 100% control over your site, it is still best to go with my original template, but this new solution is surprising versatile, and with a little CSS tweaking, you can make it a super custom experience. Set up Go to this site and click the \u0026ldquo;Create a Site Like This\u0026rdquo; button in the bottom right corner.

I\u0026rsquo;d heard somewhere that raising children eats into your free time, so I was looking for something that would allow me to make incremental progress on comics during my lunch breaks and whenever I couldn\u0026rsquo;t be sitting at my home desk with my trusty Cintiq. I\u0026rsquo;d bought the original Surface Pro on super bargain discount, and while I liked it in theory, in practice it was too slow and frustrating to do anything more than lettering or some basic inking on the go. The Surface Pro 3 promised to fix the problems of its predecessors, and to be the convergence of portability and usability that I had always been looking for. So how does the reality stack up to expectations?\nIt isn\u0026rsquo;t without its flaws, but the bottom line is that I absolutely LOVE this device. I\u0026rsquo;d never used the SP2, so the biggest and most immediate difference I noticed is the speed bump. Whereas the SP1 can be painfully slow, the SP3 is snappy and responsive, and using it is a real pleasure. It feels like it could be your main machine rather than something that you only use in a pinch, and it\u0026rsquo;s not a compromise between a tablet and a laptop anymore. If you are coming from the SP2, you might not notice the speed bump as much, but to me it was pretty dramatic.\nThe second major improvement is the larger 12 inch screen with a 4:3 ratio. The 10.6 inch 16:9 ratio SP1 and SP2 screen was bordering on unusable. With the larger screen, you aren\u0026rsquo;t fighting with the UI to wrangle enough drawing space. It also seems to have been tailor made for reading digital comics. They look absolutely gorgeous on this screen_._ Ditto for movies and web browsing. It\u0026rsquo;s really beautiful.\nThe third huge improvement is the keyboard and hinge. You can now snap it into a stable position on your lap and fold down the screen enough for drawing, which gives you access to all the keyboard shortcuts on a full keyboard. No need for hotkeys, you have everything you need right at your fingertips, which vastly ups your speed with drawing programs. I will mention that I was previously using the touch cover with the SP1 which was less than useless for typing or key commands, so I don\u0026rsquo;t know how much of an improvement it is over the older type cover, but the ability to use the keyboard for shortcuts while drawing is a game changer for me. Unfortunately, the pen is a mixed bag. Microsoft switched from using Wacom tech to N-Trig, and it isn\u0026rsquo;t so much that they cheaped out (N-Trig\u0026rsquo;s tech has some genuine benefits over Wacom) but the benefits they gained seem to be more for general purpose than drawing. The N-Trig pen tech allows for a thinner screen, which means less parallax, and it tracks a bit better than the Wacom in the corners, but the it also downgrades the pressure sensitivity from 1024 to 256 levels. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen some other reviewers say you won\u0026rsquo;t notice the pressure level difference, but I definitely noticed it. It\u0026rsquo;s not a deal breaker but you\u0026rsquo;ll probably need to tweak some of your brush settings to get a familiar feel. The pen\u0026rsquo;s system options are also very spartan right now, Microsoft has said they will add a pressure curve adjustment tool, but as of this writing, you can\u0026rsquo;t configure the pressure sensitivity to your personal pressure range at a system level. The buttons on the pen also aren\u0026rsquo;t programable anymore, so you lose quick access to an undo command on the pen, but if you are using the keyboard for shortcuts, it\u0026rsquo;s not a big deal. Still, there\u0026rsquo;s no reason not to have a pen button configuration option, and Microsoft needs to get on that. The useful eraser tip on the SP1 pen was replaced with a clicker that opens up One Note. You can\u0026rsquo;t change the program it activates, and I\u0026rsquo;m a Google Docs user, so this isn\u0026rsquo;t terribly useful for me, and I find myself accidentally clicking it while trying to put the pen in the pen loop.\nSpeaking of the pen loop, it is absolute garbage. It\u0026rsquo;s just a sticker you attach to the cover, so it could come detached if you hit it the wrong way, and you could lose your pen. It\u0026rsquo;s also an exercise in frustration trying to the get the pen in and out. I prefer just sliding the pen\u0026rsquo;s hook into the cover fold, but you need to remember to remove the pen before you open it up for the cover to hinge correctly. The pen attachment system for the old SP1 wasn\u0026rsquo;t much better, but this is definitely a downgrade. Hopefully they\u0026rsquo;ll get it right next time.\nThe magnetic power cord attachment, on the other hand, is a big improvement. With the SP1/SP2 you needed to align it with absolute precision to get it to attach, but now it\u0026rsquo;s as easy and convenient as a magsafe connector on a macbook. And the battery lasts almost as long as my iPad, which is really saying something considering they gave it a bigger screen and made it thinner and lighter. It\u0026rsquo;s a remarkable feat of engineering.\nI think the pen lag issue some reviewers noticed is a bit of an illusion. The problem isn\u0026rsquo;t that the input lags, it\u0026rsquo;s that the cursor lags independently of the input. If you move the pen to a position on the screen, the cursor will lag behind and it looks a bit slow, but if you put the pen down immediately and draw, the input will happen in the correct place before the cursor actually gets there. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit weird, but in practice, when you are drawing there is not much practical lag, and it feels pretty natural, but if you are watching the cursor, it looks worse than it is, and waiting for the cursor to catch up for hover states is a drag. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit of an annoying flaw, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t hinder productivity, which is the main concern. Also, I\u0026rsquo;m not saying there is no pen input lag, but it\u0026rsquo;s not much worse than a Cintiq. Still, I\u0026rsquo;m hoping they\u0026rsquo;ll fix the annoying cursor lag with a software update.\nAs a content consumption device it\u0026rsquo;s miles way of its predecessors. It\u0026rsquo;s light enough to hold with one hand comfortably, and did I mention how gorgeous the screen is? I think the real proof for me is that with the SP1, I was still using my old iPad 2 whenever I wanted to consume media. Since I got the SP3, my iPad is sitting unused collecting dust. As a drawing device, it\u0026rsquo;s still not quite up to Cintiq standards, but it\u0026rsquo;s not that far off either. I\u0026rsquo;m still a little faster drawing at my desk, but I honestly don\u0026rsquo;t know if that\u0026rsquo;s only because of familiarity.\nTL;DR - Great, but there\u0026rsquo;s some room for improvement.\n4 out of 5.

This is a huge milestone in any comedian\u0026rsquo;s career, and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t be more proud of him! One of the main reasons we ended Rob and Elliot was that Hampton needed to focus on his stand up and comedic writing career, so I\u0026rsquo;m so happy to see that all his hard work and sacrifice is paying off! I\u0026rsquo;ve always known he was the funniest guy around, and he has been making a name for himself in the comedy circles, but it\u0026rsquo;s really satisfying to see him succeed on a level like this.\nI know there are some even bigger things on the horizon for him, so I\u0026rsquo;ll be sure to update here when it\u0026rsquo;s time to promote them.

The main problem with naming a comic that\u0026rsquo;s about nothing in particular is that you can\u0026rsquo;t choose a descriptive or thematic name. \u0026ldquo;Scenarios I Think Are Funny\u0026rdquo; isn\u0026rsquo;t particularly catchy, and is bad SEO to boot. I figured if the name of the strip wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to be descriptive, it might as well convey my sense of humor. So I went with a pun that didn\u0026rsquo;t come up in any Google searches.\nIf you know one thing about my sense of humor, you know that I love me some puns.\nMy first instinct when writing a script is to try and be as clever as I can with joke construction. That isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily a bad instinct to have, but it can affect a joke\u0026rsquo;s accesibility if it\u0026rsquo;s pushed too far. Accesibility is pretty important for a humor strip, and I need to constantly check myself before I wreck myself. Luckily, I have an assorment of trusted friends to help me know when I\u0026rsquo;ve gone too far. Even so, I can\u0026rsquo;t help but indulge every once in a while, and I end up making a strip about MacGuffins which, if you don\u0026rsquo;t know what a MacGuffin is, doesn\u0026rsquo;t work at all.\nBut I\u0026rsquo;m ok with riding the line between accesible and niche. I want people to go back and find hidden jokes that they didn\u0026rsquo;t catch the first time. I want people to wonder if they were even put there intentionally. This would be the theme of Hamlet\u0026rsquo;s Danish if there was one. It\u0026rsquo;s not video games or pop-culture references, it\u0026rsquo;s my love and admiration for a border-line overthought joke. It may never have mass appeal, but my hope is that if a joke does hit you, it hits you hard. Hopefully it\u0026rsquo;ll find an audience, and hopefully it\u0026rsquo;s you.\n","tags":null,"title":"Word Crimes","uri":"http://localhost:1313/blog/2014/07/29/word-crimes/"},{"content":"So my wife and I had a baby last week.

Put me on a phychiatrist\u0026rsquo;s couch, and I\u0026rsquo;d probably trace it back to an excruciatingly uncomfortable college summer working for Cutco. With Rob and Elliot, I only advertised once, and we barely made a handful of merchandise because it wasn\u0026rsquo;t something that came naturally to me. I never even collected the comics into a book. I\u0026rsquo;m more of an introvert, and I really don\u0026rsquo;t like to hassle anyone if I can help it. I don\u0026rsquo;t post to social media because it feels like I\u0026rsquo;m bugging people, and my attitude has always been that I\u0026rsquo;ll try to make the comic good enough to sell itself so I don\u0026rsquo;t have to.\nThe thing is, if I want this comic to be successful, I\u0026rsquo;m going to need to get over it and change. Recently, I\u0026rsquo;ve started posting on Twitter, I finally got around to making a Facebook page, and I put a contact page in the main site menu. I\u0026rsquo;ll also be offering a print of the calico cat map from this comic as the first piece of Hamlet\u0026rsquo;s Danish merch soon.

I picked the theme this time, and I decided on Legend of Korra. I was watching this season, and thought the fire and water effects would be a good way to jump into a more painterly technique. Usually, I sketch, ink, and color with either flats, like in Rob and Elliot, or 1-2 levels of shading/highlights with gradients like in my Storm/Black Panther illustration. I wanted to try out Photoshop CS6\u0026rsquo;s new realistic paintbrushes, and this seemed like as good a chance as any.\nI started off with a pencil tool sketch.\nAfter that I blocked off the flat colors. I changed her legs to a running stride, and started working on the water distortion. The water effect is on a separate layer with the mode set to overlay. For water distortion, you can create a refraction effect by shifting the image behind the water by an even amount. I moved it a little bit down and to the left. I then added undulations in the outline with displaced spots. I left the fire as a block color for now. I started painting her face to get an idea on how I wanted the water to reflect back up onto the underside of Korra\u0026rsquo;s face. Since light bounces off and passes through the water, it casts more reflected light than an opaque object, so the dominating reflective colors are going to be from the fire and the water on either side of her body.\nHere I added most of the shading with the Flat Curve Think Stiff Bristles brush in PS with the opacity set to pressure sensitive. I picked a main light source (top-left) and visualized the objects in 3D space while adding volume with shadows and reflective lightsources. I added the water and fire reflective light with an overlay layer. The fire effect is created by building up layers of flame-like shapes progressing from orange to yellow to white. Remember that the white part is the hottest, so it should be prominent only where the flame is thickest.\nHere I added Naga, and made some corrections to Korra. You\u0026rsquo;ll notice how Naga has the reflected light sources on him as well (overlay layer with a radial gradient). I also moved the fire to intersect with the water stream and added distortion effects and a glow (overlay gradient again). I made sure to use a large size brush with more visible bristle strokes on Naga to get a fur effect.\nI\u0026rsquo;m still in progress, but here\u0026rsquo;s a zoomed in view of the fire and water effects to give you a better idea of how I achieved them. I still need to add the distortion to naga, but since I\u0026rsquo;m not 100% sure about the placement, I haven\u0026rsquo;t implemented it yet.\n","tags":["Illustration","Art Process"],"title":"Legend of Korra Process - Fire and Water","uri":"http://localhost:1313/blog/2012/11/19/legend-of-korra-process-fire-and-water/"},{"content":"Clayyount.com is live!
