      <title>The Best Style is No-Template Style</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ <a href="http://localhost:1313/blog/2015/08/12/the-best-style-is-no-template-style/"><img src="https://clayyount.com/img/ss-logo.jpg" /></a><br>&lt;h3 id=&#34;important-update&#34;&gt;IMPORTANT UPDATE: &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Due to an undocumented limit on Squarespace&amp;rsquo;s Archive List block, the current solution will not work with &amp;gt;1000 comics in the archive. If your comic archives are more than 1000, or you will reach it soon, please find another solution. I&amp;rsquo;m sorry to have launched with this limitation, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have an archive with 1000 entries to test on and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t documented, so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware of it. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping Squarespace will implement a fix to a separate bug with their itemCount API so I can use a workaround, but it&amp;rsquo;s been more than 6 months since I alerted them and they have yet to inform me when a fix is coming. As it stands, there is no way around this limitation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]>

      <title>template-less</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ <a href="http://localhost:1313/blog/2015/08/05/template-less/"><img src="https://clayyount.com/img/ss-logo.jpg" /></a><br>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-no-template-style&#34;&gt;The No-Template Style&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten some feedback on my webcomic template for Squarespace, and the two biggest complaints are that the $18 per month developer account is too expensive, and the template is too hard to customize for someone with no coding skills whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I released the template, Squarespace has made a couple updates to their platform that have allowed me to publish a new solution that doesn&amp;rsquo;t require a custom template. This means it&amp;rsquo;ll work with ANY Squarespace plan including the $8/month basic plan. I&amp;rsquo;ve also put together a video tutorial on how to get a site up and running in less than 10 minutes, as well some tutorials that cover some of the customizations you can do with your site. If you want 100% control over your site, it is still best to go with my original template, but this new solution is surprising versatile, and with a little CSS tweaking, you can make it a super custom experience. &lt;/p&gt;]]>
