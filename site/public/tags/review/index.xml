      <title>iPad Pro Review</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ <a href="http://localhost:1313/blog/2016/02/08/ipad-pro-review/"><img src="https://clayyount.com/img/ipad-pro-screenshot-1.jpg" /></a><br>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/ipad-pro-screenshot-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the iPad Pro for a couple months now, and I’m going to give my impressions strictly from an illustrator/comic artist perspective. If you want a review of the device as a laptop replacement or next-gen tablet, others have done a better job than I could, so please &lt;a href=&#34;http://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/11/ipad-pro-review-mac-like-speed-with-all-the-virtues-and-limitations-of-ios/&#34;&gt;check&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theverge.com/2015/11/11/9705966/apple-ipad-pro-review&#34;&gt;them&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imore.com/ipad-pro-review&#34;&gt;out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-does-the-drawing-experience-stack-up-against-the-competition&#34;&gt;How does the drawing experience stack up against the competition?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question most artists want answered is how well does the drawing experience stack up vs a Cintiq or a Surface Pro (3/4). The short answer is &lt;em&gt;extremely well&lt;/em&gt;. I have a Cintiq 21UX and a Surface Pro 3, and have tested the updated versions of those products in stores, and the Apple Pencil blows them away. I will get into specifics of why in a sec, but the gist of it is the Apple Pencil just feels more like a real pencil. Drawing with it feels like drawing on a real sketchpad, and the first time I tried it I was literally taken aback. The small lag I’d come to expect from using a digital stylus was &lt;em&gt;gone&lt;/em&gt;. The accuracy was &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;. The pressure curve felt &lt;em&gt;natural&lt;/em&gt;. I knew within 30 seconds that I was going to buy one.&lt;/p&gt;]]>

      <title>Surface Pro 3 Review</title>
      <description><![CDATA[ <a href="http://localhost:1313/blog/2014/08/28/surface-pro-3-review/"><img src="https://clayyount.com/img/sp3-screenshot-1.jpg" /></a><br>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/sp3-screenshot-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Baby Yount was born, I&amp;rsquo;ve been concerned about maintaining my productivity. I&amp;rsquo;d heard somewhere that raising children eats into your free time, so I was looking for something that would allow me to make incremental progress on comics during my lunch breaks and whenever I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be sitting at my home desk with my trusty Cintiq. I&amp;rsquo;d bought the original Surface Pro on super bargain discount, and while I liked it in theory, in practice it was too slow and frustrating to do anything more than lettering or some basic inking on the go. The Surface Pro 3 promised to fix the problems of its predecessors, and to be the convergence of portability and usability that I had always been looking for. So how does the reality stack up to expectations?&lt;/p&gt;]]>
