Please excuse me while I gush for a moment...

Set your DVRs for August 20th, because my brother [Hampton](http://www.hamptonyount.com) will be doing stand up on [Conan](http://teamcoco.com/schedule)! This is a huge milestone in any comedian's career, and I couldn't be more proud of him! One of the main reasons we ended Rob and Elliot was that Hampton needed to focus on his stand up and comedic writing career, so I'm so happy to see that all his hard work and sacrifice is paying off! I've always known he was the funniest guy around, and he has been making a name for himself in the comedy circles, but it's really satisfying to see him succeed on a level like this.

I know there are some even bigger things on the horizon for him, so I'll be sure to update here when it's time to promote them. Or you could just follow him on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Hamptonyount) and get a constant stream of his humor while you're at it!
