I know, I know. It's been pretty dead around here. I could attribute it to a lot of things and make excuses, but in the end, I've been allowing other things in life to take over my productivity. I tend to do this thing where I miss a deadline, then avoid the task completely because I feel bad about it. Couple that with the fact that I'm passionate about, but lose interest in things quickly, and it pretty much explains my entire update history. If I'm faced with sitting down for five hours to make a Hamlet's Danish comic, and I'm not feeling it, chances are that I'm watching TV instead. And if I do want to do something else that's creative, I feel like I have to draw the comic before I can get to it.

But then, I thought, "Wait. This is my HOBBY. Why am I stressing out?"

So I'm trying something new. Instead of holding myself to a weekly comic deadline that I know I'm not going to stick to, I'm going to harness my short attention span and make a goal of just trying to do something creative every week. It might be a Hamlet's Danish, it might be an art piece, it might be a series of sketches, it might be working on a short standalone like my Birds comic, or a longer comic issue. This way I can work on what I'm feeling passionate about, and hopefully that will make me more creative in general, and keep me from making comics I only think are kind of funny. I'm experimenting here, so let's hope it works.

Thanks to the power of the modern internet, you can still keep up with Hamlet's Danish as it updates via [RSS](http://feeds.feedburner.com/HamletsDanish), and if you follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/clayyount), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/hamletsdanish) or [Tumblr](http://clayyount.tumblr.com/), you'll get a feed of the comics plus whatever other things I work on. If you are old-school, you can also just bookmark this site where I'll be posting everything.
