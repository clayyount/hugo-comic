The No-Template Style
=====================

I've gotten some feedback on my webcomic template for Squarespace, and the two biggest complaints are that the $18 per month developer account is too expensive, and the template is too hard to customize for someone with no coding skills whatsoever.

Since I released the template, Squarespace has made a couple updates to their platform that have allowed me to publish a new solution that doesn't require a custom template. This means it'll work with ANY Squarespace plan including the $8/month basic plan. I've also put together a video tutorial on how to get a site up and running in less than 10 minutes, as well some tutorials that cover some of the customizations you can do with your site. If you want 100% control over your site, it is still best to go with my original template, but this new solution is surprising versatile, and with a little CSS tweaking, you can make it a super custom experience. 

Set up
------

1.  Go to [this site](http://five-demo.squarespace.com/) and click the "Create a Site Like This" button in the bottom right corner.
2.  Sign up for the free trial

It's built off of Squarespace's default "Five" template, so the first step is to go here and click the "Create a Site Like This" button in the bottom right corner.
