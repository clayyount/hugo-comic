I did an illustration of The Goon for an online art competition

I'm still teaching myself how to use Procreate effectively, so this one had a pretty good amount of trial and error as I was figuring things out. I also used a [modified old dutch painting technique](http://frenden.com/post/126700246437/ive-been-using-a-flemish-dead-color-technique-for) Ray Frenden blogged about, and I like it a LOT. I also have a process video if anyone is interested.
