So my wife and I had a baby last week. This may cause disruptions in my update schedule going forward. I remain optimistic that I can keep up, but we'll see. This is uncharted territory for me. I figured out how to draw with a sleeping baby on my lap, so I've got that going for me, which is nice. I'm not going to post his name on the internet, so if I need to refer to him, so I'll be calling him "Yountzilla".
