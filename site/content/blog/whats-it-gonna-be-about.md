It's been a while since I've launched, and I've been pretty bad about self promotion. I told myself that I wanted to have a bigger archive before I started telling everyone to visit the site, but if I'm being honest, I just don't like selling. Put me on a phychiatrist's couch, and I'd probably trace it back to an excruciatingly uncomfortable college summer working for Cutco. With Rob and Elliot, I only advertised once, and we barely made a handful of merchandise because it wasn't something that came naturally to me. I never even collected the comics into a book. I'm more of an introvert, and I really don't like to hassle anyone if I can help it. I don't post to social media because it feels like I'm bugging people, and my attitude has always been that I'll try to make the comic good enough to sell itself so I don't have to.

The thing is, if I want this comic to be successful, I'm going to need to get over it and change. Recently, I've started posting on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/clayyount), I finally got around to making a [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/hamletsdanish), and I put a [contact page](/contact) in the main site menu. I'll also be offering a print of the calico cat map from [this comic](http://clayyount.com/hamlets-danish-comic/2014/5/12/catography) as the first piece of Hamlet's Danish merch soon. It's only a first step, but I'm going to try to communicate and connect with you guys to offer more than a once a week comic strip update.
